### Possible Directions
0. (Theory + Empirical) explore applying DP to SOTA NLP models (e.g. BERT, GPT)
   - have not found a lot of literature on this (especially for new models), so could be a good novel direction
1. (Empirical) evaluate GANs on different datasets and see limitations
2. (Theory + Empirical) explore potential improvements on DPCGAN / GANfuscator / PATE-GAN
   - e.g.: see if can apply Tempered Sigmoid Activations (Papernot et al) in GAN architecture
3. (Theory + Empirical) explore adding DP to TimeGAN (Yoon, Jarrett, van der Schaar 2019)
